      <h1 class="title">And the Burning Bush said unto Moses, you all shall drink 8 glasses of water per day</h1>
      <p>No sooner had Moses received the 10 Commandments from the Burning Bush than came the milling hoards about him and asked, <br /> 
      "Those tables are great and all, but how many glasses of water should we be drinking per day?"</p>
      <p>And lo, he said unto them, <br />
      "You should drink 8 glasses a day!"</p>
      <p>"Ok, sure Moses," they replied, "but what's a glass? All we have are these jugs and assorted pottery."</p>
      <p>"A glass, you know, it's like 8 oz or something. I don't know, ask an American, none of their stupid measurements make sense to anyone."</p>

      <p>This site will let you track your water consumption over time. You can even save your favorite cup and it will convert "cups" to real measurements for your convenience</p>
      <p>Over time, you will see how much water you drink and which days you've been slacking off, at least until you fall so far behind that you stop logging in or water tracking becomes such a part of your life you don't need this app anymore.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Is this for real?</h3>
      <p>Well, yes and no.</p>
      <p>Yes, the app works and I encourage you to use it because drinking more water is actually a good thing</p>
      <p>No, in the sense that it's mostly created to test inserting Vue components into regular Rails views. If you know what those are, you can find the GitHub repo that drives this site <a href="https://github.com/nicholasshirley/water-me">here</a>. If you don't know what those are, it doesn't really matter, the app works.</p>
